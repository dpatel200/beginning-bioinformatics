Prompt: what is wrong in my code if i want it to display every 3rd number from 9-27 including 27?
AI: It looks like your current code in cell 6ERkG_8IfZmi is not set up to print every 3rd number. I will modify it to use a for loop and the range() function to achieve the desired output.

Prompt: explain what you changed?
AI:I modified the cell 6ERkG_8IfZmi to use a for loop with the range() function.
The range(9, 28, 3) part means:
Start at 9.
Go up to, but not including, 28.
Increase by 3 each time.
This will print the numbers 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27, which is every third number from 9 to 27.

give me a brief test to check if biopython is installed correctly
Sure, you can check if Biopython is installed correctly by trying to import one of its modules, for example, SeqIO. If the import is successful, it means Biopython is installed and ready to use.

Changed: a=3
         b=1
        while a <=30:
        print(a*b)
         a+=1

         to
        
  For number in range (9,28,3)
  print (number)
